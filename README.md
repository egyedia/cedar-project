# CEDAR Build Project

This repository contains a Maven POM for building all CEDAR Java-based components.
Note that Maven must first be executed on the  POM in the [CEDAR parent repository](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-parent) to generate
appropriate configuration information and version dependencies for the build.

For general documentation about CEDAR see [our project web site](https://metadatacenter.org/).

Developer-centric documentation can be found on the [CEDAR technical wiki](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-docs/wiki/CEDAR-technical-documentation).

Release notes can be found in the Release section of this repo.

The production web site is [here](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org).
