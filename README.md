# CEDAR Project

This repository contains a Maven POM for building all CEDAR Java-based components, and many of the issues for the CEDAR project.
To access the CEDAR application, visit [the production web site](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org).
You will be prompted to log in, and can create an account if you do not have one.

For general documentation about CEDAR see [our project web site](https://metadatacenter.org/). A complete list of CEDAR references can be found
at [our references page](https://metadatacenter.org/references).

Developer-centric documentation can be found on the
[CEDAR technical wiki](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-docs/wiki/CEDAR-technical-documentation).

Re [building CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
note that Maven must first be executed on the POM in the [CEDAR parent repository](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-parent)
to generate appropriate configuration information and version dependencies for the build.

Release notes can be found in the Release section of this repo.
